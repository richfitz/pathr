## An option is to do this as scalars if any component is an absolute
## path and is vectorised and is not _always_ absolute.  Otherwise we
## can skip ahead fairly easily.

## TODO: what should the behaviour be with NA values?  I don't think
## that they should make it through as the string "NA", which is what
## will happen if I don't do anything...
##
## Another option could be that paths that contain an NA value would
## be entirely NA, but we could use the empty string to indicate a
## path join failure and filter/test for that (as NA is currently
## treated)

## os.path.join(path, *paths)
##
##   Join one or more path components intelligently. The return value
##   is the concatenation of path and any members of *paths with
##   exactly one directory separator (os.sep) following each non-empty
##   part except the last, meaning that the result will only end in a
##   separator if the last part is empty. If a component is an
##   absolute path, all previous components are thrown away and
##   joining continues from the absolute path component.
##
##   On Windows, the drive letter is not reset when an absolute path
##   component (e.g., r'\foo') is encountered. If a component contains
##   a drive letter, all previous components are thrown away and the
##   drive letter is reset. Note that since there is a current
##   directory for each drive, os.path.join("c:", "foo") represents a
##   path relative to the current directory on drive C: (c:foo), not
##   c:\foo.
